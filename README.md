Overview

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore allows you to securely deploy and operate AI agents at scale. We'll create a basic agent that can process user input and return responses.
Step 1: Environment Setup

First, ensure you have the proper environment:
* Python 3.10 or higher installed
* AWS account with appropriate permissions
* AWS credentials configured locally

Step 2: Install Required Packages
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:

<pre>
python -m venv bedrock-agentcore-env
source bedrock-agentcore-env/bin/activate  
# On Windows: bedrock-agentcore-env\Scripts\activate
pip install strands-agents bedrock-agentcore bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit
</pre>

Step 3: Create Your Agent Code
Create a file named shahzad_ai_agent1.py
with the following code:

<pre>
from strands import Agent
from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp

agent = Agent()
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

@app.entrypoint
def invoke(payload):
    """Process user input and return a response"""
    user_message = payload.get("prompt", "Hello")
    response = agent(user_message)
    return str(response)  # response should be JSON serializable

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</pre>

Step 4: Test Locally
<pre>python shahzad_ai_agent1.py</pre>
The agent should start and be accessible locally for testing.

Step 5: Deploy to AWS
To deploy your agent to AWS: Install the Bedrock AgentCore CLI:


<pre> pip install bedrock-agentcore-cli </pre>


    Configure your deployment:


agentcore configure


Follow the prompts to set up your execution role and authentication method.

agentcore launch


Step 6: Test Your Deployed Agent

After deployment, you'll receive an agent runtime ARN that you can use to invoke your agent through the AWS SDK or CLI.
Key Benefits

    Scalable: Automatically scales based on demand
    Secure: Built-in security features and AWS IAM integration
    Flexible: Works with any agent framework
    Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use

This basic structure provides a foundation that you can expand upon to create more sophisticated agents tailored to your specific use cases. 
Remember to follow AWS security best practices, implement proper error handling, and add logging and monitoring for production deployments.
